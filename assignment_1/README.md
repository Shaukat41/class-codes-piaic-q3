We learned in quarter 2 how rust is surprisingly better programming language in performance and security. For the same reasons, Rust is being used assross a wide variety of organizations- ranging from experimental projects to production systems. In this assignment, I will discuss the two facets of Rust that enhances the perofrmance side of this language, namely Multithreading and async features that makes up what is called concurrency. Concurrency in programming means that multiple tasks can be worked on at the same time. This is possible for even a single thread of execution by interleaving the work for different tasks in chunks rather than working on tasks as entire chunks.

One of the concurrency model is asynchronous programming, or aysnc for short. You can run a alrge number of concurrentr tasks on a small number of OS threads through the async/await syntax.
